Search for documentation of a symbol in a crate or list all symbols

Usage: docsrs [OPTIONS] [CRATE_SPEC] [FILTER]

Arguments:
  [CRATE_SPEC]
          Crate path: crate[@version][::path] (e.g., "tokio", "serde@1.0", "tokio::task::spawn")

  [FILTER]
          Filter to search within the path (optional - if omitted, lists all items in path)

Options:
      --no-cache
          Skip cache and download fresh rustdoc JSON

      --clear-cache
          Clear the entire cache directory

      --color <WHEN>
          When to use colors in output.
          
          By default, `--color=auto` is active. Using just `--color` without an arg is equivalent to `--color=always`.
          
          [default: auto]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

VERSION RESOLUTION:
  When no version is specified, docsrs resolves it automatically:

  1. Direct dependency    Uses the version from your Cargo.toml
  2. Transitive dep       Resolves through the dependency chain
  3. Local/workspace      Builds docs with: cargo +nightly doc
  4. Not found            Falls back to latest version on docs.rs

LOCAL CRATES:
  Workspace crates are detected automatically and documentation is
  built using `cargo +nightly doc`. Requires nightly toolchain:
    rustup toolchain install nightly

  If the build fails but cached docs exist, they are used with a warning.

EXAMPLES:
  docsrs tokio                   Crate root (version from Cargo.toml)
  docsrs tokio::spawn            Specific item
  docsrs serde@1.0::Deserialize  Explicit version
  docsrs tokio task              Search for 'task' in tokio
